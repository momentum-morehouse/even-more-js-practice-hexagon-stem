// Problem 1
// declare a variable called fruit
// assign your variable the value 6
// console log your variable
let fruit = 6
console.log(fruit)

// write a function called product that accepts two numbers and 
// logs the product in the console and then
// returns the answer when you multiply them both together
// call that function on the numbers 4 & 689 to test it
function product (num1, num2) {
  let newProduct = num1 * num2;
  console.log(newProduct);
  returns newProduct
}
product (4, 689)

// Problem 2
// write a function called evens that takes an array of numbers, removes 
// all the numbers that are odd and returns a new array with only the even numbers
// remember that even numbers have a remainder of 0 when you divide them by 2
// call your function on this array of numbers [4, 37, 18, 29, 52, 103, 22]
function evens (array) {

//Problem 3
// write a function called five that takes a word and prints it in the console
// five times
// call your function on the word "pineapple" to test it
function five("string"){
  let word = "string"*5;
  console.log(word);
  return word;
}


//Problem 4
// write a function called shortWords that takes an array of words and then
// returns a new array with only the words that are 3 letters long or less
// call your function on this array ["basin", "pit", "cheese", "bun", "river"]

function shortWords (array){
  let newArray = [];
